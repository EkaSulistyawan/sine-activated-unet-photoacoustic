Official page for DL model with sine activation function on UNET for high-frequency photoacoustics.

# Pre-requisite and Installation

# Run your first training
To do: 
1. Give the bare minimum code to train the model
2. Make an output saved model

# Test your trained model
To do:
1. Give example code for testing
2. Give the evaluation code, e.g. SSIM, CNR, Reference, etc
3. Open the study case mentioned in the paper

# Export your model for optimized beamforming
1. Share the C++ page
2. Show the export method

# Reference paper
